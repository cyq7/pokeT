## Description

PokeT is some kind of pokedex. This application is based on external API. Due to that fact, app allows to find informations of any of the ever existing Pokemon. There are two ways how the user can query data base: 
 1) by inserting name of the pokemon in search field
 2) by using 'random' feature

App delivers information about one specific pokemon:
  - name
  - short description
  - game stats
  - evolution line
  - pokemon type strengths and weaknesses
  - abilities' descriptions

Layout colors change dynamically depending on pokemon's type.
Application is fully responsive
